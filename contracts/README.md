## I. Fixed Price Contract

In the Fixed Price contract, a seller can sell a NFT by creating a sell order with an asking price and a duration. 

The seller can create multiple sell orders. The seller do not have to transfer the NFT ownership to the fixed price contract.

Interested buyers can either purchase NFT at the seller's asking price or they can counter offer by issuing a buy order with their offering price and a duration.

Buyers that make counter offer would have their payment tokens locked up by the fixed price contract.

To get back the payment tokens, buyers must cancel their offers.

## III. Auction Contract

In the English Auction contract, a seller can sell a NFT by setting a opening bid and a duration.

Throughout the duration, interested buyers can choose to bid on the NFT. When bidding, their payment tokens are locked up by the contract.

The contract only keeps track of the highest bidder at any point of time. i.e. if user A bids 1 ZIL, user B bids 2 ZIL, user B is the current highest bid; user A would be refunded.

The seller has the rights to cancel the auction anytime, if that happens, the seller can get back the NFT ownership and the bids are refunded back to the bidders.

The seller must initiate an end process after the auction has ended, this is necessarry for the contract to compute the profits and transfer the NFT to the winner.

Sellers and buyers can claim their profits and losing bids by calling a withdraw payment tokens call.

## V. Collection Contract

In the Collection contract, brands can create and manage their collections. A collection is simply a logical grouping of NFTs. An NFT that belongs to a collection is expected to receive greater exposure to NFT buyers. In exchange for this, it shares some of the profit called `commission_fee`. The `commission_fee` is only applicable on the 1st sale of an NFT while in a collection. 

A brand can have an arbitrary amount of collections and an arbitrary amount of NFTs in each collection. To create a collection, a whitelisted user can use the transition `CreateCollection` together with a `commission_fee` value. NB this value can never be changed. 

Adding an NFT to a collection is a 2-step process. First the brand sends a request to add a specific NFT to a specific `collection_id` via the transition `RequestTokenToCollection` (brand must be the owner of the collection). Secondly, the owner of the NFT must accept the request via the transition `AcceptCollectionRequest`. 

When a sale occurs in either of the marketplace contracts (fixed price or english auction), it will call the collection contract to learn if a `commission_fee` should be paid, to which address (brand_owner) and how much. The specific call it makes is to the transition `TokenSaleCallback`. When a `commission_fee` is paid, the contract registers that as a first sale, to enforce `commission_fee` payouts to only the first sale.
