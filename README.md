# Marketplace Contracts

## Contracts

- [English Auctions](contracts/english_auction.scilla)
- [Fixed Price Listings and Offers](contracts/fixed_price.scilla)

## Contract Testing

### `yarn test`

Runs contract tests using [Isolated Server docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zilliqa/zilliqa-isolated-server) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

We run tests sequentially since block numbers are increased with `IncreaseBlocknum`.

## Royalties

Funds will be paid for secondary sales only if a marketplace chooses to implement royalty payments. Marketplaces should transfer the actual funds.

Let's assume the following:

- Your marketplace supports royalties.
- Your marketplace takes 2.5% for the service fee.
- Your marketplace can only be a spender and it doesnâ€™t hold any tokens.
- Alice created a ZRC-6 NFT contract where Alice is the royalty recipient and the royalty fee BPS is 10%.
- Alice minted an NFT and Bob is the token owner.
- Bob created a fixed price sell order with 10000 WZIL for the NFT on your marketplace. Bob is the seller.
- Your marketplace is the spender of the NFT for Bob
- Charlie fulfilled the sell order with 10000 WZIL. Charlie is the buyer.
- Your marketplace is the spender of the 10000 WZIL for Charlie.

When the sell order is fulfilled by Charlie, the marketplace contract should do the following:

- As the spender of the buyer, the marketplace contract must transfer the 1000 WZIL to Alice (royalty recipient).
- As the spender of the buyer, the marketplace contract must transfer the 250 WZIL to itself (service fee recipient).
- As the spender of the buyer, the marketplace contract must transfer the 8750 WZIL to Bob (seller).
- As the spender of the seller, the marketplace contract must transfer the NFT to Charlie (buyer).
